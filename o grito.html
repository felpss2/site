            <h1>The Scream</h1>
            <h2>The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is the popular name given to each of four versions of a composition,
                created
                as both paintings and pastels, by the Norwegian expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910.
                The
                German title that Munch gave to these works is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The works
                show a
                figure with an agonized expression against a blood red sky and an orange-yellow landscape. Arthur Lubow
                described The Scream as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."

                Edvard Munch created the four versions in various media:

                The National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, owns one of the two painted versions (1893, shown here).
                The Munch Museum owns the other painted version (1910, see the gallery below) and a pastel version from
                1893.</h2>
